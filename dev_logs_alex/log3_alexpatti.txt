Planner now has persistent storage.
Press the 'Save' Button to store the current Text in the textbox for the currently selected date
Access the stored data with the public method 'getPlannerData(date)'
where 'date' is a String of the form "DD-MM-YYYY"
Currently overhauling the ui because it is pretty bad atm.
